# Artificial Intelligence based Ecosystem Simulator

## Introduction

This project contains a visual Ecosystem Simulator contaning elements from three levels of a food chain. 
The program aims to simulate the basic life processes (movement, eating, reproduction) of the creatures
in as natural way as possible while not complicating the program too much.
